"""Pre-flight: what must be true before the first worker attempt.

Some failures are not the worker's and would look identical on every rung of
the ladder — a starting tree that was already dirty, an acceptance suite that
already failed before anything was changed, a prompt too large to fit the
rung's context window at all. Catching these once, before any attempt, means
they consume no attempt and are named as what they are: orchestration errors,
distinct from a worker's rejected change.

A :class:`PreflightIssue` is deliberately *not* a
:class:`~mcgyvr.gate.findings.Finding`.
A finding says the worker's change was not acceptable; an issue says the run
should not have started. Conflating them would charge the worker for the
environment's faults.

The dirty-tree check only reads: a starting tree that was already dirty is
reported, never destroyed, so a user is never surprised by lost work.
