"""The wire the hub serves a rider, defined once: the product's, the hub's by import.

The hub serves models to a member's rigs and the product rides them: relief
rungs (hitchhike), the ladder a rider reports, the units a host advertises,
the relay that carries a ride, and the ``/v1`` refusals a rider reads. Every
value both sides hold for that is here, once, and the hub builds its own types
from these names rather than writing them again:

* :data:`RUNG_POSITIONS`, where a relief rung's host model sits against the
  rider's ladder;
* :data:`MODEL_NAME`, the shape of a model name on the wire, and
  :data:`RUNG_PREFIX`, which with an offer's id (:data:`OFFER_ID`) names a
  relief rung's model (:func:`rung_model`, :func:`rung_offer`);
* the ladder a rider reports (``LADDER_*``);
* the units a host advertises (:data:`MAX_SLOTS`, :data:`MAX_UNITS`,
  ``UNIT_ADVERT_*``) and the rule a ride cap keeps (:func:`rider_cap_fits`);
* the relay's limits (``RELAY_MAX_*``);
* the ``/v1`` error codes with their one HTTP status each
  (:data:`API_ERROR_STATUS`), and the pairs the product reads off them
  (:data:`RUNG_BUSY`, :data:`MODEL_UNPLACED`, :data:`MODEL_NOT_FOUND`);
* the chat request fields the hub forwards to a unit
  (:data:`FORWARDED_FIELDS`, :data:`CHAT_TEMPLATE_KEYS`);
* the header naming who may serve a request (:data:`SCOPE_HEADER`,
  :data:`SCOPE_VALUES`);
* the use cases (:data:`USE_CASES`), the header a request names its own in
  (:data:`USE_CASE_HEADER`), and which use cases each pool serves
  (:data:`POOL_USE_CASES`, :func:`pool_serves`): the hub refuses the rest;
* the hub's published JSON Schemas (:data:`SCHEMAS`), shipped inside this
  package and read with :func:`schema_bytes` and :func:`schema`.

A pattern is held unanchored and matched whole (``fullmatch``); a JSON Schema
or a pydantic type writes it as ``^<pattern>$``. Nothing here is a validator
of a whole message: the hub's pydantic models and the product's readers stay
two, and each value they share is held to the schemas by the product's tests.

Stdlib only, and nothing from ``mcgyvr.cli`` or ``mcgyvr.rig``: the offline
core and the hub import this module without either.
