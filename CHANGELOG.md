## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Repo founded. Scope of record is the issue tree; forks and rationale in
  `docs/decisions/`.
- Decision `0001-founding-scope-and-boundaries` — what mcgyvr is, the
  boundaries it holds, and what it deliberately does not do.
- Vendored `baseline-skill` 2.5.0 at `tools/baseline/`, pinned by
  `tools/baseline.lock.json`.
- Capability table (`data/capability-table.json`) — measured local-model
  quality and throughput, with per-measurement provenance and the harness
  caveats that make some published numbers unusable.
- Config schema and loader (`src/mcgyvr/config.py`). The schema is
  declarative data, so the config reference can be generated from the same
  definitions the validator walks. Unknown and duplicate keys are rejected;
  credentials have nowhere to go but an environment variable NAME; values
  that are legitimately optional fail at the point of use, naming the key
  and how to bind it.
- `mcgyvr config` — validate a config file and show what it resolves to.
- Worker binding proposal (`src/mcgyvr/propose.py`). Turns a card size and
  the reachable backends into a ladder whose rungs climb in measured
  quality, stating for each binding why it was chosen and what it costs to
  pull. Equal-quality ties collapse to the faster model; a model that is
  bigger without being better is dropped by name; an unmeasured model is
  never bound. A machine with no GPU or no backend gets an empty local
  ladder and an explanation, not an error.
- `Model.best_throughput` on the capability table, restricted to
  measurements taken on a backend the model can actually run on — a figure
  from another backend describes different weights (CAV-02).

### Changed
- `pyyaml` is now a runtime dependency. The config file is YAML because it
  carries policy that needs comments to stay hand-editable (ADR-0001).
